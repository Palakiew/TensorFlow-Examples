Explained

The model above performs 4 important steps:

    It Collects Data
    It Prepares Data
    It Trains a Model
    It Evaluates the Model

In the next chapters you will learn how to program a copy of the above example.

You will learn how to fetch data, clean data, and plot data.

You will also learn how to build a TensorFlow model, and how to train the model.

    Fetch and Clean Data
    Create a TensorFlow Model
    Train the Model

Graphics (tfjs-vis)

The graphics is displayed using the tfjs-vis library.

tfjs-vis is a small library for in browser visualization intended for use with TensorFlow.js.

    Main Features are:
    Graphic tools for visualizing Machine Learning
    Functions for visualizing TensorFlow Objects
    Visualizations can be organized in a Visor (a modal browser window)
    Can be used with Custom Tools likes d3, Chart.js, and Plotly.js
